# Release Notes #
NuGet packages for the last good build on master are available via [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/IanCooper/paramore) (see Artifacts). The simplest way to work with this is to create a local NuGet source in Visual Studio for a shared directory visible to your team and download the packages there.

When we push a collection of functionality it is available via [nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org) and symbol files are published to [symbolsource.org](http://www.symbolsource.org)

This section lists features in master, available by [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/IanCooper/paramore), but not yet deployed to [nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org).

## Master ##

**Bug fixes**:

- Fixed issue #132: concurrent usages of the RabbitMQ messaging gateway would sometimes throw an exception
- Fixed issue #134: We no longer use async/await in the command processor. This caused issues with ASP.NET synchronization contexts, resulting in a deadlock when waiting on the thread that was also being used to run the completion. See http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html We wil revisit async when we write *Async versions of the CommandProcesor APIs suitable for using in hosts that can run async code without deadlocking their synchronization context.
- Fixed issue 110: Where we want to log we have two constuctors. A constructor that directly takes an iLog that you provide either directly or via your ioC container; a constructor that defaults that to LogProvider.GetCurrentClassLogger
	- In Production code you should set up your log provider and use the constructors that do not take an ILog reference.
	- In Test code you should inject the ILog using a fake logger. We don't recommend testing log output, its an implementation detail, unless its an important part of your acceptance criteria for that behaviour.
	- This means that your production code should not need to take a direct dependency on Paramore's ILog implementation.
	- This is a BREAKING CHANGE because we remove the ability to inject the constructor via the *Builder objects, so as to remove the temptation to do that when you should rely on the LibLog framework to wrap your current logger.


## Release 5 ##

**Bug Fixes:**
 - #100 `CommandProcessor.Post` fails with Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
 - Fix RequeueMessage exhaustion to log ERROR.
 - #101 Updated `Requeue` method to send a message to a specific queue as opposed to a topic.
 -  Added a message store write timeout and message gateway timeout on a post; perviously we wait indefinitely (bad Brighter team, no biscuit).
 - Replace `Successor` write-only property with `SetSuccessor` method.
 - Message Viewer, fixed startup issues.
 - Removed a few unused interfaces.
 - Correct exceptions namespace to actions.

**Features:**
 - A connection can now be flagged as isDurable in the configuration. Choosing isDurable when using RMQ as the broker will create a durable channel (i.e. does not die if no one is consuming it, and thus continues to subscribe to messages that match it's topic). We think there are sufficient trade-offs with a message store that allows replay to make this setting false by default, but have configured to allow users to make this choice dependent on the characteristics of their consumers (i.e. sufficiently intermittend that messages would be lost).
 - #92 Added [Event Store](https://geteventstore.com/ "Event Store") Message Store implementation
 - #30 Changed RabbitMQ Messaging Gateway to support multiple performers per connection, fixing the pipeline errors from RabbitMQ Client
 - Added a UseCommandSourcing attribute that stores commands to a command store. This is the Event Sourcing paradigm described by Martin Fowler in http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html The term Command Sourcing refers to the fact that as described the pattern stores commands (instructions to change state) not events (the results of applying those commands).
	- This may result in a breaking change that the Id on IRequest requires a setter to allow it to be deserialized
 - Added MS SQL Command Store implementation
 - Added monitoring attribute, which fires message onto control bus
 - Cleaning up code so working with dnx and Portable will be easier
 - Message Viewer, Add paging
 - Update Code of Conduct to Contributor Covenant 1.1.0
 - Add DDL scripts to help create SQL based schemes

**Remove and Depreciated:**
 - Flag the method `Repost` on `IAmACommandProcessor` as obsolete, We will probably drop this in the next release. We suggest that you use the message store directly to retrieve a message and then call Post.
 - Dropped support for RavenDb as a message store, we feel EventStore covers this scenario better where non-relational stores are an option
 - Removed release branch. We just tag a release on master now, so this only existed to support an older version of the library that was pre the tagging strategy. Removed now as confusing to new users of the library.

## Release 4.0.215 ##
1. Fixed an issue where you could not have multiple UsePolicy or FallbackPolicy attributes on a single handler.#
2. We pool connections now, to prevent clients with large number of channels overwhelming servers.
3. Add concept of delayed (deferred) message sending.
4. Implement delayed requeuing using gateway support (when supported).
5. Delayed message provider support for RabbitMQ using [rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange plugin (3.5+)](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange/).
6. Renamed RequeueException to DeferMessageAction and moved it into the command processor project.
7. Fixed and issues with unhandled exceptions from handlers when an event is published not been logged correctly
8. The first early version of a Message Store Viewer has been release as a zip file download

## Release 3.0.129 ##
1. We now support a Fallback method on IHandleRequests<TRequest> which is intended to be used for compensating or emergency action when a Handle method cannot be executed. The [FallbackPolicy] attribute supports the pipeline calling the Fallback method for you, in the event of either any exception bubbling into the handler, or a broken circuit exception bubbling into the handler.
2. Fix issue with RabbitMQ consumers running on a High Availability cluster not cancelling properly after cluster failover.
3. Fixed bug with config section duplication https://github.com/iancooper/Paramore/issues/52
4. Added functionality so after a specified number of unacceptable message (unable to read from queue or map message) a connection is shutdown, by default unacceptable message are acked and dropped. https://github.com/iancooper/Paramore/issues/51
5. Move RequeueException to paramore.brighter.commandprocessor.exceptions (breaking change).

## Release 3 ##


1. Refactored **IAmAMessagingGateway** into a **IAmAMessageConsumer** and **IAmAMessageProducer** to support differing approaches to producing and consuming messages for a particular flavour of Message-Oriented-Middleware. *These changes are a breaking binary change for users of earlier versions.*
	1. NOTE: IF YOU USE TASK QUEUES PLEASE SAVE YOUR SERVICEACTIVATORCONNECTIONS IN YOUR APP.CONFIG AS THE V2.0.1 BRIGHTER.SERVICEACTIVATOR UNINSTALL WILL DELETE THEM (FIXED FOR V3)
2. Created an **IAmAChannel** abstraction to allow differing Application Layer dependencies for the Work Queue
2. Upgraded Packages we depend on, including RabbitMQ. *There is still an issue with our having a hard dependency on a RabbitMQ client that might vary from your RabbitMQ client version, but as a NuGet package there are few workarounds. We suggest building from source where this issue is problematic, for now.*
3. Significant stability improvements on the RabbitMQ client
	1. Fixed issues around re-connection of the client leading to lost messages.
	2. Fixed issues when explicitly closing and re-opening connections
	3. Provided support for a **RequeueException** to requeue messages that are 'out-of-time' to help with resequencing.
	1. We now dispose of channels aggressively on closure, instead of waiting for garbage collection
2. Moved from [Common.Logging](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging) to [LibLog](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog)  *These changes are a breaking binary change for users of earlier versions.*
3. We now call Release for all **RequestHandler<>** derived handlers that we construct from an **IAmAHandlerFactory**, not just those that implement IDisposable.
4. Note that the RestMS server is **NOT** ready for production usage. It's primary value, as of today, is an alternative to RabbitMQ for design purposes. It is hoped to produce a stable version for use as a ControlBus in a future release.

        <h2>Timeout</h2>
        <p>Calls to remote components, such as a database, broker, or http service can fail. Code that makes assumption that they will
            succeed is subject to the <a href="http://mira.sai.msu.ru/~megera/docs/Web/systems/fallacies.pdf"><em>fallacies of distributed computing</em></a>,
            in particular that the network is reliable.</p>
        <p>For this reason we need to set a limit on the time we wait for a response from the a server (or other remote resource). Otherwise we risk tying up a thread waiting for a response that will never come.
        This can potentially cause a cascade effect: as the number of blocked threads on the server handling the request waiting for a response increase that server can in turn become unresponsive or even
        actively refuse requests.</p>
        <h2>Retry</h2>
        <p>In the presence of unreliable calls between two components our first approach to achieving a high quality of service is to recognize that many such failures
        are transient: a timeout because a resource is busy, temporary loss of connectivity, the loss of one node that will be replaced by failover to another. In this case
            the fault is self-correcting, the node comes up, the load on the database or server declines and their is capacity for our call, or network connectivity is restored.
            This means that our call will succeed if we retry after a delay to allow the transient fault to resolve.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589788.aspx">Retry</a> pattern is simply that if the call fails, we can try again. It is important to have an upper bound on retries in case a
            fault that appears transient is not. See Circuit Breaker as well.</p>
        <p>We need to exercise caution with a multiple retry approach that is does not overload a service that already has too many requests with increased traffic (an Attack of Self-Denial).
            For this reason we should delay further retry attempts by using an algorithm that increases the interval between retries</p>
        <p> It is useful to use a retry policy library that encapsulates calls within a retry policy, instead of forcing each call to a remote component to implement retry afresh. We recommend
            <a href="https://github.com/michael-wolfenden/Polly"><strong>Polly</strong></a> as a suitable library on the .NET framework. Brighter supports this through its ExceptionPolicy assembly
            which provides an attribute for running subsequent steps in the pipeline within a retry policy. The
            <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh680934%28v=pandp.50%29.aspx">Transient Fault Handling Application Block</a> provides similar functionality, though we don't have explicit
            support for it in Brighter</p>
        <h2>Circuit Breaker</h2>
        <p>The problem with Retry to fix transient issues in a remote resource may be that continued retries by clients of a server exacerbate the problem - an attack of Self-Denial. In some circumstances,
            it can be better to stop further requests to the server until a timeout has passed instead of retrying.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589784.aspx">Circuit Breaker</a> pattern is intended to protect a server that is suffering from excessive load and prevent cascade failures
            from that component failing</p>
        <p>The metaphor is of a wiring circuit breaker. When it is closed, electric current flows, when it is open current does not flow through the wires. This can prevent excess load from damaging the system.</p>
        <p>We can use the same approach with calls to servers, allow calls whilst the circuit is closed, and not when the circuit is opened following us triggering the ciruit (perhaps due to catching
            an exception or timing out. An additional aspect it that the circuit remains open for a time period, after which we put the circuit in a half-open state. The next call 'tests' the circuit.
        If the call succeeds we close the circuit, if the call fails we wait for another time period (possibly increasing the delay with each try) before half-opening again. </p>
        <p>The client needs to handle a broken circuit gracefully - one option is for a server to throttle requests when it breaks a circuit</p>
        <p> It is useful to use a cicruit breaker library, instead of forcing each call to implement afresh. Again we recommend
            <a href="https://github.com/michael-wolfenden/Polly"><strong>Polly</strong></a> as a suitable library on the .NET framework. Brighter supports this through its ExceptionPolicy assembly
            which provides an attribute for running subsequent steps in the pipeline within a Circuit Breaker policy.</p>

# Specification Quality Checklist: AWS SNS/SQS Generated Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)

- [x] CHK003 Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] CHK006 Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- CHK001/CHK008: The spec necessarily references project names, file paths, and tool names (test generator, LocalStack, Podman) because the feature IS about tooling infrastructure. These are not "implementation details" in the traditional sense — they are the domain objects of this feature.
- CHK003: The audience for this spec is framework contributors, not business stakeholders. The language reflects that appropriately.
- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/clarify` or `/plan`.

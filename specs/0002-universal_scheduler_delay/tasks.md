# Implementation Tasks: Universal Scheduler Delay Support

**Spec**: 0002-universal_scheduler_delay
**ADR**: [0037-universal-scheduler-delay.md](../../docs/adr/0037-universal-scheduler-delay.md)

## Overview

This task list implements universal scheduler delay support as defined in ADR-0037. The implementation follows TDD and is organized in phases to enable incremental development across multiple PRs.

### Transport Summary

| Transport | Current Delay Approach | Native Support | Required Change |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| InMemory | Direct timer | No | Use scheduler via producer |
| RMQ Async | `Task.Delay()` fallback | Yes (DelaySupported flag) | Use producer when native unavailable |
| RMQ Sync | `Task.Delay().Wait()` fallback | Yes (DelaySupported flag) | Use producer when native unavailable |
| Kafka | No-op (immutable stream) | No | Use producer for delayed send |
| MQTT | Returns false | No | Use producer for delayed send |
| MsSql | Ignores delay | No | Use producer for delayed send |
| Postgres | Native SQL UPDATE | Yes | No changes needed |
| Redis | Delay removed (TODO) | No | Use producer for delayed send |

## Phase 1: Fix InMemoryScheduler Thread Safety

Before using the scheduler more broadly, we need to fix the race condition identified in the ADR.

- [x] **TEST + IMPLEMENT: InMemoryScheduler uses atomic operations for timer management**
  - **USE COMMAND**: `/test-first when scheduling message with existing id should atomically replace timer`
  - Test location: `tests/Paramore.Brighter.Core.Tests/Scheduler`
  - Test file: `When_scheduling_message_with_existing_id_should_atomically_replace_timer.cs`
  - Test should verify:
    - Concurrent Schedule calls with same ID don't cause race conditions
    - Timer is properly disposed before replacement
    - No orphaned timers remain after concurrent operations
  - **⛔ STOP HERE - WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL in IDE before implementing**
  - Implementation should:
    - Replace check-then-act pattern with `AddOrUpdate` in `InMemoryScheduler.cs:67-79`
    - Ensure timer disposal is atomic with replacement
    - Apply same fix to async variant at lines 186-198

    - Scheduler is NOT invoked
    - Works regardless of whether scheduler is configured
  - **⛔ STOP HERE - WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL in IDE before implementing**
  - Implementation should:
    - Add early return in `SendWithDelay()` when delay == TimeSpan.Zero
    - Call `Send(message)` directly

Alternatively, all transport updates (Phases 6-11) could be combined into a single PR after PR 1.

## Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Task |
|------|-----------------|
| Breaking existing tests | Phase 2 task: "falls back to timer when no scheduler" |
| Performance regression | Phase 2 task: "sends immediately when delay is zero" |
| Lazy producer not disposed | Each phase includes disposal task |
| Race conditions in scheduler | Phase 1 task: "atomic operations for timer management" |
| Blocking message pump | All transports use non-blocking producer approach |

## Notes

- All tests should use `FakeTimeProvider` for deterministic time control
- Run existing test suite after each phase to catch regressions early
- Each transport's test infrastructure may need Docker containers (RMQ, Kafka, etc.)
- Postgres already has native support - verify and document, no changes expected

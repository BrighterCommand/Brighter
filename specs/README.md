# Brighter Specifications

Brighter is a CQRS and Messaging Framework for .NET. It is designed to allow message passing both internally, using a [Command Oriented Interface](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandOrientedInterface.html), and externally using a range of messaging middleware. We refer to the middleware colloquially as a transport.

This specification folder was originally created to work with GenAI agents by creating specifications they could use.

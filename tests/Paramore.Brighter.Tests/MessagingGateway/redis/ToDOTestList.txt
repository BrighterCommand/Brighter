** When you cannot get a connection from a pool?
The PooledRedisClientManager imposes a maximum connection limit and when its maximum pool size has been reached will instead block 
on any new connection requests until the next RedisClient is released back into the pool. If no client became available within PoolTimeout, 
a Pool TimeoutException will be thrown.

** We can also get a RedisException of various forms
* RedisResponseException Did not have that type i.e. set list etc.
* RedisRetryableException Did not have enough bytes of data when read ?

** Allow setting of the connection retry interval and maximum retry window

To improve the resilience of client connections, RedisClient will transparently retry failed Redis operations due to 
Socket and I/O Exceptions in an exponential backoff starting from 10ms up until the RetryTimeout of 10000ms. 
These defaults can be tweaked with:

    RedisConfig.DefaultRetryTimeout = 10000;
    RedisConfig.BackOffMultiplier = 10;
    

** Delay
To support delay we want to implement a priority queue within Redis
This may actually help us with the issue of creating a generic priority queue i.e. send to Redis and then later forward 
via another producer if required. Should be a design goal, allows use of Redis as a 'hangfire' alternative


** Request/Response
We should support this, how? Look at RedisMQ

# BRT001: Request Type Missing

## Description
This rule ensures that a `Publication` object creation has a `RequestType` assigned. Without specifying the request type, Brighter cannot determine which message type this publication or subscription is for.

## Why is this a warning?
Failing to specify the `RequestType` will lead to runtime errors or incorrect message routing, as the system won't know how to handle the publication or subscription.

## How to fix
Assign a valid request type to the `RequestType` property during object initialization.

### Example
```csharp
// Warning: RequestType is missing

var publication = new Publication { 
    // Missing RequestType
};

// Fixed: RequestType is assigned
var publication = new Publication { 
    RequestType = typeof(MyRequest) 
};
```

    ///     to consume messages from the server or
    ///     <see cref="CommandProcessor.Post{T}" /> to send a message to the RabbitMQ server.
    ///     A channel is associated with a queue name, which binds to a <see cref="MessageHeader.Topic" /> when
    ///     <see cref="CommandProcessor.Post{T}" /> sends over a task queue.
    ///     So to listen for messages on that Topic you need to bind to the matching queue name.

    ///     collection that contains a set of connections.
    ///     Each subscription identifies a mapping between a queue name and a <see cref="IRequest" /> derived type. At runtime we
    ///     read this list and listen on the associated channels.

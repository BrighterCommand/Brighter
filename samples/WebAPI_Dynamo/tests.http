### Clean up between runs if needed

DELETE http://localhost:5000/People/Tyrion HTTP/1.1

### Add a Person

POST http://localhost:5000/People/new HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Name" : "Tyrion"
}

### Now see that person

GET http://localhost:5000/People/Tyrion HTTP/1.1


### Now add some more greetings
### Note that in the DynamoDb sample, Greetings are unique, so repeated attempts to add the same greeting will fail to write any new greetings

POST http://localhost:5000/Greetings/Tyrion/new HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Greeting" : "I drink, and I know things #1"
}

### And now look up Tyrion's greetings

GET http://localhost:5000/Greetings/Tyrion HTTP/1.1

- Capturing standard out, standard error and trace streams in ReSharper 8
(7 does this for us) and the console runners. Output is added to the test result
XML/HTML. (#158)
- Some fixes for behaviors in ReSharper (#155)

Machine.Specifications 0.5.15
-----------------------------
Fixed an issue with running two spec assemblies: When the first one fails and
the second one succeeds mspec.exe reported success. I needed to introduce a
breaking change in the runner, so older versions are not compatible with 0.5.15.
Update your ReSharper runners when upgrading to 0.5.15!

Machine.Specifications 0.5.14
-----------------------------
- Closed #146: MSpec doesn't fail when Machine.Specifications cannot be found for
a spec assembly. Can be useful if you want to target mspec.exe to a NUnit
assembly, which is now a no-op.

Machine.Specifications 0.5.12
-----------------------------
- ReSharper 8 support
- dotCover 2.5 support by Alexander Mikhailov
- Documented --filters parameter for mspec.exe by Pieter Germishuys

Machine.Specifications 0.5.11
-----------------------------

- Console output (mspec.exe) is now colored by default. You can disable colored
output with the --no-color switch
- Added progress output for the console runner (--progress switch)
- The console runner now prints a list of failed specifications at the end of
the test run (for silent, progress and verbose reporting options)
- Support for custom delegates (i.e. you can replace Establish, Because, It,
Cleanup, Behaves_like) with your own versions as long as the delegate signatures
match. Please note that this currently only supported for console and
TestDriven.Net runners. ReSharper won't find your context/specs if you use
custom delegates. See Machine.Specifications.Example.CustomDelegates for an
example. -- Thanks Jonathan Dickinson!
- Fixed an issue with the ReSharper runner and generic Behaviors like
Behaves_like<Behavior<Foo>> a_blah_blah;
- Improved double-click navigation for behavior specifications in ReSharper
- Dropped support for ReSharper 6.0
- Fixed bug #17 which caused ReSharper to run IAssemblyContexts for each
specification in an assembly (now the behavior is the same as with the console
runner - running them once per assembly)
- Matt Ellis contributed code that allows you to filter for "unit test usages"
in ReSharper -- thank you!

Machine.Specifications 0.5.10
-----------------------------

- ReSharper 7.1 support
- Various fixes for ReSharper:
  - Retrieving Subject from outer class
  - Context sort order
  - Unimplemented specs are being reported as inconclusive

Machine.Specifications 0.5.9
----------------------------

- Removed ReSharper runners for ReSharper 4.1, 4.5 and 5.0
- Added runner for dotCover 2.1
- Updated runner for Gallio 3.4

Machine.Specifications 0.5.8
----------------------------

- ReSharper 7.0 runner for RTM
The installer batches now copy the plugin to a folder that's shared between
Visual Studio versions, i.e. install for both VS 2010 and VS 2012 at the same
time
- Some fixes for ReSharper not picking up TagsAttribute correctly
- New extension method `ShouldBeLike` to test multiple object properties at once
using an anonymous object.
Might be useful for DTOs, we have some samples here: http://bit.ly/Op7tmP

Machine.Specifications 0.5.7
----------------------------

- Updated ReSharper 7.0 EAP runner (it's the same as in the prerelease
packages)

TeamCity autodetection in certain scenarios (http://bit.ly/KrOqIh)
- Added code snippets for VS to the repository (http://bit.ly/KrOrMi)

Machine.Specifications 0.5.6
----------------------------

- Fixes for the ReSharper runner:
Our internal unit test data structures caused the runner to silently break on
renames. Corrected contexts with [Tags("foo")]; besides "foo", they also got the
ReSharper category of "object".

- New ShouldMatch extension method allowing for custom assertions with a
Func<T, bool>. Thanks Tomas Ekeli!

Machine.Specifications 0.5.5
----------------------------

- For CLR4 projects, there are new extension methods in the M.S.Clr4 assembly
that should make testing Task<T> easier. Thanks Albert Weinert!

- Updated Gallio Adapter, works against Gallio 3.3.454. Thanks Niels Hanberg!

- ReSharper 6.1 templates for MSpec's delegates - see Misc\*.DotSettings in the
repository. I wrote a blog post some time ago how to use them,
http://bit.ly/xRZf2s
Thanks @sksbrg!

- Runner for the current ReSharper 7.0 EAP for VS 11
Thanks Alexander Zeitler!

- Updated result supplementer for Selenium WebDriver. An example:
http://bit.ly/A48A2I

- Made AssertComparer public, it should be easier to write custom Should*
extension methods now.

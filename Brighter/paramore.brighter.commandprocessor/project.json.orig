  "description": "The Command Dispatcher pattern is an addition to the Command design pattern that decouples the dispatcher for a service from its execution. A Command Dispatcher component maps commands to handlers. A Command Processor pattern provides a  framework for handling orthogonal concerns such as logging, timeouts, or circuit breakers",

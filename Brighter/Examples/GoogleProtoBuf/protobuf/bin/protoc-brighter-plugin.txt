The protoc-gen-brighter.exe is a plug-in for the Google Protocol Buffers protoc.exe compiler that creates Brigher specific files 
to allow ProtoBuf generated classes to be derived from IRequest and thus be first class message objects within Brighter.

The compiled binary is included here, but can be re-built with the project included in the Brigher examples if you need it to 
follow different rules.

The protoc-gen-brighter.exe plug-in looks for message class names that end in "Event", "Request", "Response" and "Command".  When
the message name ends in one of these it will produce the Brighter partial class extensions needed.

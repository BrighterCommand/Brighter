# 25. Scoping dependencies inline with lifetime scope

Date: 2025-01-03

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As it stands dependency Lifetime Scopes are wrapped around the `Command Processor` meaning that all options performed by an instance of the Command processor will share the same scope, this becomes problematic when using the `Publish` method as this allows for multiple `Request Handlers` to be subscribed to a single Event, this will mean that all handlers share dependencies in the same scope which is unexpected behavior.

## Decision

When the Handler Factories are configured to not be a singleton Scopes will be created for each Lifetime, and a new lifetime will be given for each registered subscriber.

## Consequences

We will no longer require a `Command processor provider` as this was only created for scoping, and Handler factories will require the lifetime scope to be passed in to all methods so it can use this for managing scopes.

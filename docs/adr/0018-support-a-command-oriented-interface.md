# 18. Support A Command Oriented Interface

Date: 2024-07-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Brighter supports the Command side of Command-Query Separation and Darker the Query side. See [ADR 0017](0017-use-strict-cqs-across-brighter-and-darker.md)

This allows Brighter to support building a [Command Oriented Interface](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandOrientedInterface.html).

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

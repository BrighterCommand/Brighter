# 10. Support OpenTelemetry standards 

Date: 2024-04-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

 There are three main standards of interest to us when working with OTel:

* [Semantic Convetions for Messaging Systems](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/messaging/README.md)
* [Semantic Conventions for Cloud Events](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/cloudevents/README.md)
* [Trace Context](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/)

All of these standards are designed to work together to provide a common way to pass context information between services. For Brighter to participate well in an OTel ecosystem we need to support these standards. Up to this point our approach to OTel has tended to use custom information over the standards described here. We need to review our approach to OTel and ensure that we are working with these standards.

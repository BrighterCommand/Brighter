# Documentation

- Update or add Documentation comments for all exports from assemblies.
  - To be clear exports: means all public and protected methods of public classes/structs/records/enums.
    - We do not add Documentation comments internal or private classes, or internal methods
  - Documentation are indicated by `///`
  - Documentation comments use XML
  - Documentation comments show up in Intellisense for developers. Bear this in mind when writing comments, as they should be helpful to a developer using the API but not so verbose that a developer would not choose to read it when using intellisense. Use `<remarks>` for notes on implementation or more detailed instructions.
  - They should also be helpful to a developer or LLM reading the code.
  - We provide some guidance on specific elements:
  - Use `<summary>` element to provide an overview of the purpose of the class or method. What behavior or state does it encapsulate? What would you use it for. Use `<paramref>` if you refer to parameters in the summary.
  - Use the `<param>` tag to describe parameters to a constructor or method.
    - Use `<see cref="">` to document the type of the parameter
    - Indicate what the parameter is for, what effect setting it has and if it is optional. If it is optional describe any default value and its impact.
    - The developer should be clear what values they need to provide for the parameter to control desired behavior.
  - Use `<returns>` to indicate the `<see cref="">` of the return type, optionality, and what the value represents.
  - Use `<typeparam>` to indicate the intent of a generic type parameter; document any constraints on the type.
  - Use `<exception>` to document any exceptions that the method call can throw.
  - Use `<value>` to document a property. Like a `<summary>` it should indicate purpose. Like a `<param>` or `<return>` it should use `<see cref="">` to indicate type.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the current status.
/// </summary>
/// <value>The current status as a <see cref="string"/>.</value>
public string Status { get; set; }
```

- Use `<remarks>` for advice to developers or LLMs working with the code directly. Include information on how the method is implemented where it is not obvious from the code or significant design decisions have been made. Consider what you would want to know if maintaining this method. Use `<see href="">` if you need to link to external documentation.  This can also be used for more detailed information than could be included in the `<summary>`.
  - Prefer to use good variable and method names to express intent, over inline comments.
    - Use the refactoring "Extract Method To Express Intent" to encapsulate code in a named method that explains intent, over using a comment.
    - Do not add comments for what may be easily inferred from the code.
    - In tests you may use //Arrange, //Act, //Assert.
    - If code has a complex algorithm or non-obvious implementation, prefer to use `/// <remarks>`
  - Example:

  ```csharp
  /// <summary>
  /// Sends a message to the specified recipient.
  /// </summary>
  /// <param name="recipient">The recipient's address.</param>
  /// <returns>The message ID.</returns>
  public string SendMessage(string recipient) { ... }
  ```  

- Documentation comments should be changed when APIs change.  
- Document new features and changes in the Docs repository of the BrighterCommand organization.

## Architecture Decision Records

We are using Architecture Decision Records (ADR) to record important design decisions that we make. When you make a significant decicion about design, that would be useful as context to future reviewers, or explorers of the codebase, please record your design decision as an ADR.

Place ADRs in the [ADR directory](../adr) 

The template for the ADR is in our [first ADR](../adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md).

An ADR should follow the naming convention [Sequence Number]-[Title].md

Scan the ADR directory for existing ADRs to determine the next [Sequence Number] to use.

Use dash-case (aka kebab-case) for the [Title] of the ADR.

## Licensing

- We add a license comment to every src file
- The license should be at the very top of each source file, before any using statements or code.
- We use the MIT license.
- You should add your name and the year, if it is a new file.
- You should put the license comment in a `# region License` block
- An LLM should use the name and year of the contributor instructing the LLM
- As an example

```csharp
#region License

        <h1>Implementing Ports and Adapters</h1>
        <p> A ports and adapters architecture is an <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/vit/ftp/pdf/intro_softarch.pdf">architectural style</a> that follows the layered architectural style, but has some additional
        constraints and invariants around the layers.</p>
        <p>The Components are layers. Each component comprises a group of sub-tasks which implement an abstraction at some layer in the hierarchy. Each layer provides services to the layer above it and acts as a client to the layer below.</p>
        <p>The Connectors are the protocols that define how the layers can interact.</p>
        <p>Lower layers can pass data and service requests to higher layers via notifications (i.e. an observable)</p>
        <p>A hexagonal architecture has three layers: adapter, ports, and domain</p>
        <h2>The Domain Layer</h2>
        <p>The domain is constrained to avoid concerns outside the process boundary i.e. I/O and as such should consist of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object">POCO</a> classes. Thus we should not have
        references to libraries such as System.Web and System.IO which live in the layers that implements communication with us, or from us to other processes.</p>
        <p>We include developer tests as something that lives outside the domain, so we should have no testing framework in this layer either</p>
        <h2>The Adapter Layer</h2>
        <p>Adapters are where we implement communication between our process and other processes. This is where the frameworks we use for I/O and our tests live. They layer is constrained not to communicate directly with the domain, but a port.</p>
        <h2>The Ports Layer</h2>
        <p>A port is the means by which an adapter exercises the domain. The adapter may not exercise the domain directly but must use a port which forms a use case or scenario boundary for the domain.</p>
        <p>The port provides co-ordination and control of the domain in response to a request from a primary adapter,and communication of other ports with secondary adapters.</p>
        <p>We recommend using the <a href="CommandsCommandDispatcherandProcessor.html">Command</a> pattern to implement Ports.</p>
        <p>This use case is also described as implementing the Command Invoker pattern within a service by
            <a href="http://www.servicedesignpatterns.com/">Service Design Patterns</a>. The <a href = "http://servicedesignpatterns.com/WebServiceImplementationStyles/CommandInvoker">Command Invoker</a>:
            <blockquote>Create command objects that fully encapsulate common request processing logic. Instantiate and invoke these commands from within the web service,
            or forward them to an asynchronous background process. </blockquote>
            We would identify this as Ports layer, with the service endpoint being in the Adapters layer.

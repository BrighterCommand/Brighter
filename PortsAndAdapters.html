        <h2>Ports & Adapters</h2>
        <p><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Ports and Adapters</a> is a <em>hierarchical architectural style</em> which makes clear the separation between the <em>Domain Model</em> -
            which contains the rules of our application - and the <em>Adapters</em>, which abstract the inputs to the system and our outputs. The advantage of this style is that the
            application is decoupled from the nature of the input or output device, and any frameworks used to implement them.</p>
         <p>For example when a client POSTs a request to the REST API exposed by our application the Adapter recieves the HTTP request, transforms it into a call onto our Domain,
             and marshals the response back out to the client over HTTP. Similarly if our application needs to retrieve persisted entity state to initialise the domain it calls out to an
             Adapter that wraps access to the Db.</p>
        <img src="images/Hexagonal%20Architecture.png"/>
          <p>The layer between the Adapter and the Domain is identified as the <em>Ports</em> layer. Our Domain is inside the Port, Adapters for external concerns are on the outisde of the port.
              The notion of a 'port' invokes the OS idea that any device that adheres to a know protocol can be plugged into a port. Similarly, many adapters may use our Ports.</p>
          <p>One particular asset is <em>testability</em>. Our tests can be written against the Ports, instead of the Adapters. This decouples our tests from the Adapters - which may change over time
              as we add or remove frameworks that we wish to use to surface the application (for example switching from Webforms to ASP.NET MVC). It also means that our functionality must be contained
              inside the Port, against which the test runs, and cannot bleed into other layers. A traditional problem of layered architectures is bleeding of domain logic out of the Domain and into the
              <em>Presentation</em> layer. The Ports and Adapters model seeks to solve this, by forcing Adapters to use the API exposed by the port. Writing TDD unit tests at this layer means that the
              test driven-development pushes the domain logic required to implement them behind the Port.</p>
            <p>We have a notion of <em>primary</em> and <em>secondary</em> actors in use cases which map to the Adapter and Port layer. Primary actors exercise our application, they are inputs into our application.
                A primary actor uses a primary Adapter, which calls a primary Port - the chain is one of inputs into our application. So our REST API is a primary Adapter, so are our tests.
                A secondary actor is one that our application exercises as part of its work, they are outputs from out application. So our Db is a secondary Adapter, as our mocks and we talk to them
                over a secondary Port. Many applications seem to consist only of one primary and one secondary, but once we factor in tests we may begin to observe that
                we have more, and by building for multiple Ports we make our application more modifiable to new ports in future.</p>
             <p>We often show primary Ports on the left and secondary Ports on the right.</p>
             <p>A Port is the 'use case boundary'. Use cases become problematic when they become focused on technology concerns. Use cases written against the ports can elide those concerns and focus
                 on the application rules, making them easier to write and maintain. There is a correlation here between the use case boundary and the test boundary - tests should focus on the behaviour
                 expressed by a use case, not on a unit of code. Contrary to Cockburn, I don't suggest using a ATDD like FIT or SpecFlow here, preferring to use our xUnit test tool here (and not test
                 implementation details).</p>
        <h1>Clean and Onion Architectures</h1>
        <p>A number of architectures have similar properties to a ports and adapters architecture, such as the <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">Onion Architecture</a>.
            In essence they all have the hierarchical architectural style, specifically a layered style, with similar invariants and constraints around the components and connectors within that architectural style.

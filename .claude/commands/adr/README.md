# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Commands

This directory contains Claude Code commands for creating and managing Architecture Decision Records in the Brighter project.

## Commands

### `/adr <title>`

Creates a new Architecture Decision Record following Brighter's template and conventions.

**Purpose**: Streamlines the process of creating properly formatted and numbered ADRs, ensuring consistency and completeness.

**Usage:**
```bash
/adr kafka message serialization strategy
```

**What it does:**

1. **Auto-numbers**: Scans `docs/adr/` to find the next sequence number
2. **Links to specs**: Automatically links to current specification if one exists
3. **Follows template**: Uses the structure from ADR 0001 and comprehensive examples
4. **Gathers information**: Prompts for key ADR content (context, decision, alternatives, consequences)
5. **Creates file**: Generates properly named file in `docs/adr/[NNNN]-[title].md`
6. **Updates tracking**: Adds to spec's `.adr-list` if applicable

**File Naming Convention:**
- Format: `[NNNN]-[title].md`
- 4-digit sequence number with leading zeros (e.g., `0037`)
- Dash-case (kebab-case) title
- Example: `0037-kafka-message-serialization-strategy.md`

**ADR Structure:**

The command creates ADRs with these sections:
- **Title and Date**: Number, descriptive title, creation date
- **Status**: Starts as "Proposed", changes to "Accepted" when approved
- **Context**: The problem, requirements, constraints
- **Decision**: What you're doing and WHY
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, risks and mitigations
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options and why rejected
- **References**: Links to requirements, related ADRs, external docs

## Integration with Specification Workflow

The `/adr` command integrates with the [specification workflow](../spec/README.md):

- **Standalone**: Use anytime you need to document an architectural decision
- **With specs**: Automatically links to current spec and updates `.adr-list`
- **Design phase**: Part of the `/spec:design` workflow

When a current spec exists (in `specs/.current-spec`):
- ADR includes link to parent requirement
- ADR is tracked in `specs/[spec]/.adr-list`
- Can be approved with `/spec:approve design [NNNN]`

## Why Use ADRs?

From [.agent_instructions/documentation.md](../../../.agent_instructions/documentation.md):

Architecture Decision Records capture important design decisions that provide context to future reviewers and explorers of the codebase. They answer:

- **What** decision was made
- **Why** it was made (most important!)
- **What alternatives** were considered
- **What consequences** resulted
- **What context** influenced the decision

## Best Practices

**One Decision Per ADR**:
- Keep ADRs focused on a single architectural decision
- Better to have multiple small ADRs than one large one
- Makes them easier to review, reference, and supersede

**Common ADR Topics**:
- Message serialization strategy
- Error handling approach
- Persistence/storage mechanism
- API design and contracts
- Performance optimization strategy
- Security model
- Testing approach
- Concurrency model

**Workflow**:
1. Create feature branch
2. Write ADR(s) - use `/adr` command
3. Commit ADR as first commit: `git commit -m "docs: add ADR for [title]"`
4. Create draft PR for early feedback
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Approve with `/spec:approve design [NNNN]` (changes status to "Accepted")
7. Proceed with implementation

**Multiple ADRs Example**:

A single feature might need several ADRs:

```bash
# Feature: Kafka Dead Letter Queue
/adr message serialization strategy       # ADR 0037
/adr error classification approach        # ADR 0038
/adr dlq persistence mechanism            # ADR 0039
/adr retry and requeue strategy           # ADR 0040
```

Each ADR is:
- Focused on one decision
- Can be reviewed independently
- Can be referenced separately
- Can be superseded individually

## Example Session

```bash
$ /adr kafka message serialization strategy

Scanning docs/adr/ for next sequence number...
Next ADR: 0037

Found current spec: specs/0001-kafka-dead-letter-queue/
This ADR will link to that specification.

What is the architectural problem or decision to be made?
> We need to decide how to serialize messages when sending them to
> the Kafka dead letter queue. The messages need to be readable for
> debugging but also preserve all original data.

What is your proposed solution?
> Use JSON serialization with UTF-8 encoding. Store the original
> message body as a base64-encoded string within the JSON structure...

What alternatives did you consider?
> Protocol Buffers - rejected because not human-readable
> Avro - rejected because adds schema registry dependency
> Raw bytes - rejected because not debuggable

What are the key consequences?
> Positive: Human readable, easy debugging, no additional dependencies
> Negative: Larger message size, potential encoding issues

✓ Created: docs/adr/0037-kafka-message-serialization-strategy.md
✓ Added to: specs/0001-kafka-dead-letter-queue/.adr-list

Status: Proposed

Next steps:
1. Review the ADR and edit as needed
2. Commit: git commit -m "docs: add ADR for kafka message serialization strategy"
3. Create more ADRs for other decisions in this feature
4. Approve with: /spec:approve design 0037
```

## Approving ADRs

To change status from "Proposed" to "Accepted":

```bash
# Approve specific ADR
/spec:approve design 0037

# Approve all ADRs for current spec
/spec:approve design
```

This updates the Status field in the ADR from "Proposed" to "Accepted".

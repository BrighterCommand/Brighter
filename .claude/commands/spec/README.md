# Specification-Driven Development Commands

This directory contains Claude Code commands that implement a specification-driven development workflow for Brighter contributions. These commands help you follow Brighter's preferred contribution workflow: **Issue → Requirements → ADR(s) → Tasks → Tests → Code**.

## Overview

The spec commands provide a structured approach to designing and implementing features:

1. **Requirements**: Capture user needs and problem statements
2. **Design (ADRs)**: Document architectural decisions (can have multiple ADRs per requirement)
3. **Tasks**: Break down implementation into actionable steps
4. **Implementation**: Follow TDD to write tests and code

## Commands

### `/spec:new <feature-name>`

Create a new specification for a feature.

```bash
/spec:new kafka-dead-letter-queue
```

Creates:
- `specs/NNNN-kafka-dead-letter-queue/` directory
- Updates `specs/.current-spec` to track active spec
- Creates initial README.md in spec directory

---

### `/spec:requirements [issue-number]`

Create or update requirements specification for the current spec.

**With GitHub Issue:**
```bash
/spec:requirements 123
```
- Pulls issue content from GitHub
- Creates `requirements.md` based on issue
- Stores issue number in `.issue-number` file
- Optionally adds comment to issue linking to requirements

**Without Issue:**
```bash
/spec:requirements
```
- Creates template `requirements.md` for you to fill in
- Optionally creates new GitHub issue

**Features:**
- Creates `specs/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Shows next ADR number to use
- Offers to create feature branch (or use current branch)
- Template focuses on user requirements (technical details go in ADRs)

---

### `/spec:design [focus-area]`

Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for a specific architectural decision.

**Multiple ADRs per Requirement:**
You can (and should) create multiple focused ADRs for different aspects of a requirement. Each ADR should address one specific architectural decision.

```bash
# First ADR - message serialization
/spec:design message-serialization

# Second ADR - error handling strategy
/spec:design error-handling

# Third ADR - persistence layer
/spec:design persistence-strategy
```

**Features:**
- Creates ADR in `docs/adr/NNNN-{focus-area}.md`
- Tracks all ADRs in `specs/{current-spec}/.adr-list`
- Shows existing ADRs to avoid duplication
- Links back to requirements specification
- Uses standard ADR template with sections:
  - Status (Proposed/Accepted)
  - Context (the specific architectural problem)
  - Decision (what we're doing and why)
  - Consequences (positive, negative, risks)
  - Alternatives Considered
  - References

**Best Practices:**
- Keep each ADR focused on ONE architectural decision
- Create separate ADRs for different concerns (e.g., data model, API design, error handling)
- First ADR should be the first commit on your feature branch
- Include diagrams (ASCII art or mermaid) where helpful

---

### `/spec:approve <phase> [adr-number]`

Approve a specification phase or specific ADR.

**Approve Requirements:**
```bash
/spec:approve requirements
```
- Creates `.requirements-approved` marker
- Allows progression to design phase

**Approve All ADRs:**
```bash
/spec:approve design
```
- Updates Status from "Proposed" to "Accepted" in ALL ADRs for current spec
- Creates `.design-approved` marker
- Allows progression to tasks phase

**Approve Specific ADR:**
```bash
/spec:approve design 0043
```
- Updates Status to "Accepted" only for ADR 0043
- Useful for incremental approval as ADRs are reviewed
- Once all ADRs approved, can create `.design-approved` marker

**Approve Tasks:**
```bash
/spec:approve tasks
```
- Creates `.tasks-approved` marker
- Allows progression to implementation

---

### `/spec:review [phase] [adr-number]`

Review the current specification phase or specific ADR.

**Auto-detect Current Phase:**
```bash
/spec:review
```
Reviews the first unapproved phase automatically.

**Review Requirements:**
```bash
/spec:review requirements
```
Shows requirements.md with checklist.

**Review All ADRs:**
```bash
/spec:review design
```
- Shows all ADRs for current spec
- Displays status (Proposed/Accepted) for each
- Provides summary: X ADRs total (Y approved, Z proposed)

**Review Specific ADR:**
```bash
/spec:review design 0043
```
Shows only ADR 0043 with detailed checklist.

---

### `/spec:tasks`

Create implementation task list based on approved design.

```bash
/spec:tasks
```

Creates `tasks.md` with:
- Overview and task breakdown
- Phases: Foundation, Core, Testing, Deployment
- Checkboxes for tracking progress
- Task dependencies
- Risk mitigation tasks

**Requirements:**
- Design must be approved (`.design-approved` exists)
- All ADRs should be reviewed and approved

---

### `/spec:status`

Show status of all specifications.

```bash
/spec:status
```

Displays:
- All specification directories
- Current active spec (marked with *)
- Phase completion status for each spec
- ADR approval status (Proposed/Accepted)
- Linked GitHub issues
- Task progress (if applicable)
- Recommended next action

**Example Output:**
```
Specification Status Report
===========================

Active Spec: specs/0001-kafka-dlq/ (marked with *)

* specs/0001-kafka-dlq/
  Issue: #123

  Requirements: ✓ Approved

  Design (ADRs):
    - docs/adr/0042-kafka-dlq-message-serialization.md [Accepted]
    - docs/adr/0043-kafka-dlq-error-handling.md [Proposed]
    - docs/adr/0044-kafka-dlq-persistence.md [Accepted]
  Status: ⏳ In Progress (1 ADR pending approval)

  Tasks: ✓ Approved
    Progress: 15/30 tasks complete (50%)

  Next Action: Approve ADR 0043 or begin implementation
```

---

### `/spec:switch <spec-name>`

Switch to a different specification.

```bash
/spec:switch 0002-another-feature
```

Updates `specs/.current-spec` to the specified spec directory.

---

### `/spec:implement [task-number]`

Begin TDD implementation of approved specification.

```bash
# Implement all tasks
/spec:implement

# Implement specific task
/spec:implement 3
```

**Requirements:**
- Tasks must be approved (`.tasks-approved` exists)
- All ADRs must be approved (Status: Accepted)

**Strict TDD Workflow with Approval Gates:**

The implement command follows a rigorous Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

**🔴 RED Phase - Write Failing Test:**
1. Identifies the next behavior to implement
2. Writes a failing test following [docs/agent_instructions/testing.md](../../../docs/agent_instructions/testing.md):
   - Test naming: `When_[condition]_should_[expected_behavior]`
   - File per test: `When_[condition]_should_[expected_behavior].cs`
   - Arrange/Act/Assert structure with explicit comments
   - Evident Data pattern
   - Tests public exports only (no private/internal methods)
   - Uses InMemory* implementations for I/O (no mocks for isolation)
3. Runs test to verify it fails correctly
4. Shows test to user with explanation

**✅ USER APPROVAL - Critical Gate:**
- **MUST get explicit user approval before writing implementation**
- Uses AskUserQuestion to request approval
- If changes requested, modifies test and asks again
- **No implementation code written without approval**

**🟢 GREEN Phase - Make Test Pass:**
1. Writes minimum code to make test pass
2. Follows [docs/agent_instructions/code_style.md](../../../docs/agent_instructions/code_style.md):
   - .NET C# naming conventions
   - Responsibility Driven Design
   - Avoid primitive obsession
   - Keep methods small and focused
3. Runs test to verify it passes
4. Runs all tests to ensure no regressions
5. Shows implementation and results

**🔵 REFACTOR Phase - Improve Design:**
1. Reviews code for design improvements
2. Applies "Tidy First" principles (structural changes only)
3. Keeps methods small, single responsibility
4. Uses expressive types instead of primitives
5. Runs all tests after each refactoring
6. Shows refactored code with explanation

**After Each Cycle:**
- Commits changes with descriptive message
- Updates tasks.md to check off completed task
- Asks user: continue to next test or review?

**Example Session:**
```
🔴 RED: Writing test When_message_is_invalid_should_send_to_dead_letter_queue
      [Shows test] Test fails: "Method not found" ✓

✅ APPROVAL: Should I proceed to make this test pass?
      User: Yes

🟢 GREEN: Adding SendToDeadLetterQueue method
      [Shows code] Test passes ✓ All tests pass ✓

🔵 REFACTOR: Extracting validation logic
      [Shows refactoring] All tests still pass ✓

✓ Committed: feat: add dead letter queue for invalid messages
```

## Best Practices

### Requirements
- Frame problem as user story: "As a [user] I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
- Focus on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- Keep it concise - technical details go in ADRs
- Link to GitHub issue for traceability

### ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- **One architectural decision per ADR** - stay focused
- Common ADR topics:
  - Message serialization strategy
  - Error handling approach
  - Persistence/storage mechanism
  - API design and contracts
  - Performance optimization strategy
  - Security model
  - Testing approach
- Focus on WHY, not just WHAT
- Document alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Use diagrams to illustrate architecture
- Cross-reference related ADRs
- First ADR should be first commit on feature branch
- Create draft PR with ADRs for early feedback

### Tasks
- Break down into small, testable increments
- Follow TDD: write tests before implementation
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Include risk mitigation tasks

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch (or use existing)
2. Commit first ADR: `git commit -m "docs: add ADR for message serialization"`
3. Commit subsequent ADRs: `git commit -m "docs: add ADR for error handling"`
4. Create draft PR with ADRs for review
5. Implement incrementally with TDD
6. Update ADR status to "Accepted" when approved

## Why Multiple ADRs?

A single requirement might involve several distinct architectural decisions:

**Example: Kafka Dead Letter Queue Feature**

Instead of one large ADR covering everything, create focused ADRs:

1. **ADR 0042: Message Serialization** - How to serialize/deserialize messages for DLQ
2. **ADR 0043: Error Classification** - How to determine which errors send to DLQ
3. **ADR 0044: Persistence Strategy** - How to store DLQ metadata
4. **ADR 0045: Retry Mechanism** - How to handle retries from DLQ

**Benefits:**
- Each ADR is focused and easier to review
- Can approve ADRs independently as they're ready
- Easier to reference specific decisions later
- Can supersede individual decisions without affecting others
- Better traceability of architectural evolution
